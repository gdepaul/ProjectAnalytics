    Right now, I'm just laying down some of the GUI that will 
    probably change 90% after we get the full spec. As of now,
    I'm just kind of sure of what the GUI for dispatch will 
    look like, from the ppt presentation slide. 
    
    Working idea:
    
    Dispatch will keep track of field supervisor dispatch
    operations. Right now, I think that's just dropping
    off and picking up cash. So, we need to keep track of
    dispatch requests(when, from who, how much, field supe
    sent). May want to have a field somewhere that has access
    to how much money is out there, a running total of the 
    negative balance.
    
    Robustness:
    A)Missing money:
    	I)Must keep a record of how much each club has taken.
    	II)Must make sure that requests and transactions
    	 	are confirmed from when the order is placed and when
    	 	money is moved.
    	 	   -Will think about this more.
    
    B)Problems with program: 
    	I) If field supe is already dispatched, don't allow to 
    		be dispatched again until order is completed.
    		 -If things get hectic, a field supe might try to
    		 take care of multiple orders at the same time. This 
    		 includes some risk, but may be more practical. Might
    		 have to create a robust solution to allow for this.
    	II) If a dispatch is incorrectly performed, must allow for
    		and undo.
    		  -I think it's best to only allow an undo for the 
    		  last dispatch command.
    		  -On the other hand, it could simply be a matter of
    		  showing the dispatch complete, and then rebalancing
    		  the budget as necessary.
    		  -In any case, undos should be logged.

    			int current_wallet)

    					String fieldSupeID,
    					String, action,
    					int, time_in)
